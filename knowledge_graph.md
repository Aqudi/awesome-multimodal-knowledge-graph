# Knowledge Graph

A **Knowledge Graph** is a structured Knowledge Base. **Knowledge Graphs** store facts in the form of *relations* between different *entities*. By extracting facts from a knowledge base and representing these facts in the form *entities* and *relations*, a knowledge graph claims to have an understanding of the information.

More formally, a **Knowledge Graph** is a very large semantic nets that integrate various and heterogeneous information sources to represent knowledge about certain domains of discourse.
* A **graph** is a mathematical structure in which some pairs in a set of objects are somehow related.
* We describe **knowledge** to the actions of an agent.
* An agent would interpret a knowledge graph to make rational decisions to take actions to reach its goals.
