### A Multimodal Translation-Based Approach for Knowledge Graph Representation Learning
  * Sergieh et al. (2018.06)
  * SEM'18
  * Current methods for knowledge graph (KG) representation learning focus solely on the structure of the KG and do not exploit any kind of external information, such as visual and linguistic information corresponding to the KG entities. In this paper, we propose a multimodal translation-based approach that defines the energy og a KG triple as the sum of sub-energy functions that leverage both multimodal (visual and linguistic) and structural KG representations. Next, a ranking-based loss is minimized using a simple neural network architecture. Moreover, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for multimodal KG representation learning. We compared the performance of our approach to other baselines on two standard tasks, namely knowledge graph completion and triple classification, using our as well as the WN9-IMG dataset. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms all baselines on both tasks and datasets.

### MMKG: Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs
  * Liu et al. (2019.03)
  * arXiv
  * We present MMKG, a collection of three knowledge graphs that contain both numerical features and (links to) images for all entities as well as entity alignments between pairs of KGs. Therefore, multi-relational link prediction and entity matching communities can benefit from this resource. We believe this data set has the potential to facilitate the development of novel multi-modal learning approaches for knowledge graphs. We validate the utility of MMKG in the sameAs link prediction task with an extensive set of experiments. These experiments show that the task at hand benefits from learning of multiple feature types.

### Multi-modal Knowledge-aware Hierarchical Attention Network for Explainable Medical Question Answering
  * Zhang et al. (2019.10)
  * ACM-MM'19
  * Online healthcare services can offer public ubiquitous access to the medical knowledge, especially with the emergence of medical question answering websites, where patients can get in touch with doctors without going to hospital. Explainability and accuracy are two main concerns for medical question answering. However, existing methods mainly focus on accuracy and cannot provide good explanation for retrieved medical answers. This paper proposes a novel Multi-Modal Knowledge-aware Hierarchical Attention Network (MKHAN) to effectively exploit multi-modal knowledge graph (MKG) for explainable medical question answering. MKHAN can generate path representation by composing the structural, linguistics, and visual information of entities, and infer the underlying rationale of question-answer interactions by leveraging the sequential dependencies within a path from MKG. Furthermore, a novel hierarchical attention network is proposed to discriminate the salience of paths endowing our model with explainability. We build a large-scale multi-modal medical knowledge graph and two real-world medical question answering datasets, the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance on our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
